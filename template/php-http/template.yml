  You have created a new function which uses PHP 8.0 and the OpenFaaS
  of-watchdog which gives greater control over HTTP responses.
  composer require can be used to add third-party packages like guzzlehttp/guzzle or ramsey/uuid
  By default it uses psr-7 request/response objects to represent http communication.
